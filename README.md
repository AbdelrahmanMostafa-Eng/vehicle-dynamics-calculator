# 🏎️ Vehicle Dynamics Calculator

A Python project for calculating basic vehicle dynamics—useful for motorsport applications and a good starting point for FSAE or Formula Student.

---

## 📘 Features
- Braking distance calculator  
- Weight transfer during cornering (longitudinal and lateral) 
- Lateral acceleration estimation  
- Simple tire load sensitivity model

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters
- ***Applies real physics to code -*** Combines vehicle dynamics theory with practical Python implementation 
- ***Builds a foundation for motorsport work -*** Uses calculations directly relevant to FSAE and race engineering 
- ***Start simple, build complexity -*** Simple enough to start, modular enough to expand into full simulations

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Install dependencies (numpy, matplotlib if plotting is used)  
3. Run and enter vehicle parameters (mass, speed, tire coefficient, etc.)  
4. View calculated results in the terminal or graphs

## 🚧 Future Improvements
- Add graphical visualization (matplotlib plots)  
- Expand to include aerodynamics effects  
- Build a simple GUI for user input  
- Integrate with telemetry data in future projects
